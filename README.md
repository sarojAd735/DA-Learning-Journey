# 📊 Learning Journey – Daily Mini Projects

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository documents my **daily learning journey** through hands-on mini projects built on **real-world datasets**.  
The focus is on **applied learning**—using tools and techniques in practical scenarios to strengthen analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.

The **first 5 days** focus on **intermediate-level Excel**, emphasizing analysis, business use cases, and insight generation rather than basic functionality.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply Excel in real-world, business-oriented scenarios  
- Strengthen analytical and problem-solving skills  
- Build structured mini projects daily  
- Document insights and decision-making approaches

## 📅 Learning Plan (Days 1–5: Applied Excel)

### 📘 Day 1: Data Profiling & Advanced Cleaning
**Focus:** Understanding data quality and structure  

**Key Concepts:**
- Data profiling (row counts, null checks, uniqueness)  
- Removing duplicates with business rules  
- Handling missing data logically (not blindly)  
- Text normalization (TRIM, CLEAN, case handling)  
- Date and number standardization

## 📅 Day 2 – Key Insights (Excel Analysis)

- Total patient records analyzed: 49,999
- Average billing amount: $25,555.26
- Average length of hospital stay (LOS): 15.5 days
- Emergency admissions: 16,388 (32.8%)
- Non-emergency admissions: 33,611 (67.2%)
- Distinct medical conditions observed: 6
- High-risk patients (Age > 60 & Billing > 20,000): 22.6%

Data observations:
Hospital and doctor counts are unusually high relative to patient count, suggesting synthetic or record-level identifiers.
Billing averages across admission types are similar, indicating evenly distributed billing behavior in the dataset.

### 📘 Day 3: Pivot Tables for Analytical Insights
**Focus:** Summarizing and analyzing data effectively  

- Built multiple pivot tables to analyze billing, patient volume, and length of stay
- Compared average and total billing across admission types
- Analyzed LOS patterns by admission urgency
- Evaluated high-risk patient distribution across age groups
- Added interactive slicers for dynamic filtering

Key Insights:
• Billing per patient is consistent across admission types
• Emergency admissions show the highest average LOS
• High-risk patients are predominantly Adults and Seniors
• High billing category represents the majority of patient records

**Focus:** Communicating insights clearly  

**Key Concepts:**
- Chart selection based on insight type  
- Pivot charts & dynamic visuals  
- Conditional formatting for storytelling  
- Interactive elements (slicers, filters)  
- KPI-style summary views
