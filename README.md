# 📊 Learning Journey – Daily Mini Projects

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository documents my **daily learning journey** through hands-on mini projects built on **real-world datasets**.  
The focus is on **applied learning**—using tools and techniques in practical scenarios to strengthen analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.

The **first 5 days** focus on **intermediate-level Excel**, emphasizing analysis, business use cases, and insight generation rather than basic functionality.
