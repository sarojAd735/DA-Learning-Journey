1️⃣ Patient distribution is evenly split by gender

The dataset shows a balanced gender distribution, with 24,988 male and 25,011 female patients out of 49,999 total records.
This indicates no significant gender-based skew in hospital admissions.

2️⃣ Non-emergency admissions dominate hospital volume

Non-emergency admissions account for approximately 67% of total cases, while emergency admissions represent about 33%.
This suggests that planned and urgent care drives the majority of hospital activity, rather than emergency-only demand.

3️⃣ Billing per patient is consistent across admission types

The average billing amount is approximately $25,000 across Elective, Urgent, and Emergency admissions.
This indicates uniform billing behavior, with admission type having minimal impact on per-patient costs in the dataset.

4️⃣ Emergency admissions show slightly higher length of stay

Emergency cases have the highest average Length of Stay (LOS) compared to elective and urgent admissions.
This reflects greater clinical complexity and resource utilization associated with emergency care.

5️⃣ A significant portion of patients are classified as high risk

High-risk patients were defined as those aged over 60 with billing amounts exceeding $20,000.
Based on this definition, 22.56% of patients fall into the high-risk category, highlighting a substantial group requiring closer clinical and financial monitoring.

1️⃣ Prioritize operational planning for non-emergency admissions, which account for the majority of hospital volume.

2️⃣ Allocate additional resources for emergency care due to higher average length of stay.

3️⃣ Implement proactive monitoring strategies for high-risk patients, particularly seniors with high billing amounts.

4️⃣ Review cost-control measures for emergency admissions while maintaining consistent billing practices.

5️⃣ Continue equitable care planning supported by balanced gender distribution.
